# matchEmUp
# Mohammad Alabed and Ahmad Saleh

# Here we have an even number of cards and the goal is to match up the cards with the same cards. If possible we will have the cards stay 
# flipped in place if two of the same cards are flipped in succession. The main goal is to randomize the cards when flipped and have two be flipped
# at a time and then reset. If we have time we will also add a point system to the game so when two cards are matched you will earn points.
